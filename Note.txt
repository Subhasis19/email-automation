A venv (short for "virtual environment") is a tool in Python that creates an isolated environment for your project. This means:

Each project can have its own dependencies, regardless of what dependencies every other project has.
You avoid conflicts between package versions.
You don’t need admin rights to install packages.
How to use venv:

Create a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment:
venv\Scripts\activate

Install packages (they stay inside the venv):
pip install package_name

Deactivate when done:

Summary:
venv helps keep your project’s dependencies organized and separate from your system
